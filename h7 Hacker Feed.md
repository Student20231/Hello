Due to the requirements of the homework found from Karvinen (2023), this is what I could have executed: 

# X) Summary 
### *Helsec presentation: Flubot - Pandemic in our pocket*

1. Jauhiainen (2023), an experienced digital forensics and incident response professional, gave a presentation at Helsec about the Android banking malware "Flobot", iniatially detected in December 2020;
2. Flobot which undergoes constant development, unveiling new versions and features on a monthly basis was disseminated through SMS and MMS;
3. The way Flobot can deceive users is by disguise itself as a legitimate application;
4. Flobot establishes a command and control (c2) link through DNS or HTTPS using providers such as Google, Cloudflare, and Alibaba;
5. The malware employs domain generation algorithms (DGA) and regularly updates the seed for generating c2 domains;
6. Recently, the Flobot campaign has been reactivated, underscoring the need for continuous vigilance and analysis due to the malware`s ongoing evolution.

# a) Install and test an RSS feed reader

According to Zapier (2023), 'feedly' is one of the best  RSS feed reader. Thus, I went to the respective site to use feedly (Feedly, 2023) instead of installing it in my computer as shown below:

and looked for "finance" related feeds:
