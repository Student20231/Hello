Due to the requirements of the homework found from Karvinen (2023), this is what I could have executed: 

# X) Summary 
### *Helsec presentation: Flubot - Pandemic in our pocket*

1. Jauhiainen (2023), an experienced digital forensics and incident response professional, gave a presentation at Helsec about the Android banking malware "Flobot", iniatially detected in December 2020;
2. Flobot which undergoes constant development, unveiling new versions and features on a monthly basis was disseminated through SMS and MMS;
3. The way Flobot can deceive users is by disguise itself as a legitimate application;
4. Flobot establishes a command and control (c2) link through DNS or HTTPS using providers such as Google, Cloudflare, and Alibaba;
5. The malware employs domain generation algorithms (DGA) and regularly updates the seed for generating c2 domains;
6. Recently, the Flobot campaign has been reactivated, underscoring the need for continuous vigilance and analysis due to the malware`s ongoing evolution.

# a) Install and test an RSS feed reader

According to Zapier (2023), 'feedly' is one of the best  RSS feed reader. Thus, I went to the respective site to use feedly (Feedly, 2023) instead of installing it in my computer as shown below: 

<img width="664" alt="Feedlysite" src="https://github.com/Student20231/Hello/assets/149126670/6801b84c-136e-46fe-9e5e-2cd83acf4118">

and looked for "finance" related feeds:

# b) Add feeds from Ycombinator Hacker News and Schneier

I was able to add the Schneier feed but not the Ycombinator Hacker News as it can be seen below:

<img width="218" alt="Schneier" src="https://github.com/Student20231/Hello/assets/149126670/ad234f55-8745-4b38-8f0e-c3437a3431cb">

<img width="649" alt="Unreachable feed" src="https://github.com/Student20231/Hello/assets/149126670/03f5383c-5129-4431-b2fe-0cabfc27a69c">

Going to the last tab "Google News", I could find a "Ycombinator Hacker News" but I would have to upgrade the feedly to get access to that feed.

# c) Find another interesting security related feed

I found the Cyber "Security â€“ Strategy and Innovation" that refers to certain topics that I am currently following such as visual analytics and innovation in cyber security.
