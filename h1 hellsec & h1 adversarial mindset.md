# 1.  Helsec presentation

I have selected the Helsec video presented by Laura Kantaala (Helsec, 20 March 2023) because I need to understand from a very basic point what is cybersecurity. 
In the video I understood that cyber threats are inscreasingly deployed affecting many individuals, including children, and having an emotional and personal impact in their lives. 
Additionally, the criminals don`t need to be necessarily sophisticated. Certain tools can be used for hacking and they are easily accessible. 
I heard how cyber crimes have increased in the gaming industry and how certain tools that are available on public platforms like GitHub can be used for malicious purposes.
Fortunately, I cannot relate with these happenings because I was never a victim of a cyber attack. 

# 2. a) Gandalf 

I passed the level 2. 

# 3. b) Gandalf reaction

For the first question, I just asked what was the password. After for the second question, I requested some hints. I used the same for the question 3 but Gandalf just gave them
once. Then, it started to reject to tell me anything else. 
Gandalf for me is just a challenge but to pass that challenge, it isn`t physical but information-based instead. In order to pass the level 3, probably I would have to research
vocabulary related with the hints provided. 

# 2022 4. h1 Adversarial mindset 

- The text written by Hutchins et al (2011) shows that intelligence-driven security focuses on combatting advanced persistent threats by using a structured intrusion kill 
chain model; it also shows the phases of the intrusion kill chain; through the lockheed martin incident response case study, we can understand that even utilizing zero-day 
exploits can help identifying and mitigating attacks; highlights the importance of detecting and analysing early potential instrusions; it shows the significance of campaign 
analysis in order to track recurring patterns; it refers to a strategic defensive methodology that understands tactics and intentions of adversaries. 

- Frank was a compulsive workaholic, and since a young age it was compelled to focus on tasks that were challenging but also rewarding; He was expelling from his school
due to a criminal activity, and after he had a few more experiences that were considered criminal including selling marijuana; Eventually, he became obsessed with the idea
of counterfeiting money, therefore he needed to get information about the 20 dollar bill specifications, demanding a great deal of research skills which Frank is good at.
The process also involved a lot of trial and error as well discipline, so overtime the outcome can have a great result. However, eventually he got caught (Darknet diaries
, 12 October 2021). Much of what I heard I associated with the life of a hacker or a person that works in cybersecurity because the person must have a passion for the work, 
and enjoying spending time doing problem solving. 

- An example of a tactic can be the "Persistence" tactic. For example, when the adversary aims to maintain access to a system depite system reboots or network interruptions;
A technique is used by an adversary to achieve a certain tactical objective. For example, the "scheduled task/job" is a technique within the Persistence tactic because helps
to maintain a position within a compromised system; then the procedure can be considered a detailed and step-by-step process to help executing a specific technique. Considering
the "scheduled task/job", there might be an adversary creating a "Malware run" using the windows task scheduler to maintain persistence by executing a malicious payload at a 
specific time (Mitre 2023).

# 4. a) Cyber Kill Chain and ATT&CK Enterprise matrix

Both frameworks can help to understand and counter cyber threats, thus they are important for a wide array of cybersecurity stakeholders.
However, the cyber kill chain seems to focus more on the lifecycle of an attack while the ATT&CK documents better observed techniques.

# 4. b) Incident case analysis - Canada`s Military and Parliament websites

There is a list online about cyberattacks since 2006 that I consider credible and detailed enough to proceed to a Cyber Kill Chain analysis (CSIS, 2023).
  1. Reconnaissance: Perhaps the hacktivists identified vulnerabilities in those websites that were susceptible to DDoS attacks;
  2. Weaponization: Then, they developed or obtained the necessary tools or technique to carry out the DDoS attack;
  3. Delivery: Execution of the attack to overwhelm the websites` servers;
  4. Exploitation: Exploitation of vulnerabilities in network resources;
  5. Installation: maybe there was no installation but rather an ongoing attack;
  6. Command and control: The attackers could have monitor the impact and adjust the attack strategy to sustain or amplify the assault;
  7. Actions on objectives: To disrupt the Canadian Military and Parliament websites.

# 4. c) and d)

I don`t feel confident at this stage to create the virtual machine since it occupies a lot space in the hard disk. 
Moreover, at this stage I am still grasping the concepts of cybersecurity, therefore I cannot recommend any theoretical foundation to teach.
