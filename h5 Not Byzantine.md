Due to the requirements of the homework found in Karvinen (2023), this is what I could have executed: 

# X) Summaries
### *Nakamoto 2008: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*

1. Nakamoto (2008), discussed how online payments work, which are quite dependable on middlemen and for that, he suggested a computational transaction that is more secure and prevents reversals, making it more difficult to hack; 
2. The proposed electronic coin system uses a chain of digital signatures for ownership. Since the main challenge is preventing double-spending, the suggested solution is to publicly announce transactions and have participants collectively agree on their order; 
3. The transaction begins with a timestamp server that proves that the information existed at that specific time, which strengthens the previous ones by including them in its code;
4. In order to make sure everyone agrees on the order of the transactions, the proof-of-work method is used like a puzzle in which computers get to decide the order of transactions, ensuring fairness and security in the system;
5. Thus, whenever someone wants to make a transaction in the network, they tell everyone and computers group these transactions into blocks;
6. Then in this system, the first transaction in a block creates a new coin for the block`s creator, motivating nodes to support the network. This process, compared to gold miners adding gold to circulation, uses CPU time and electricity, and as more coins circulate, the incentive can shift to transaction fees. 


# a) Wallet. Creation of a BitCoin testnet wallet.

For the creation of the Bitcoin testnet wallet I followed the tips provided by Karvinen (2023). The procedure in the Debian terminal was the following:

# b) Faucet. Getting worthless fake money from a testnet Bitcoin faucet.



# c) Giveway. Moving money to another Bitcoin wallet. Choosing an amount where the last two digits are 42.



# d)  Explorer. Using a block explorer to analyze a block on the real Bitcoin blockchain.
