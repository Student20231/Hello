- The chapter 2, authored by Schneier (2015), defines protocols as agreements between two or more parties. The cryptographic protocols, in particular, is to prevent cheating
where participants cannot do or learn more than the pre-specified in the protocol. To illustrate, these protocols go beyond simple secrecy, such as sharing secrets, joint
computation, identity verfication or contract signing.
In this chapter, it is identified different types of protocols such as arbitrated protocols, adjudicated protocols, and self-enforcing protocols.
The author goes further to state that attacks against protocols may happen when hackers try to involve altering the protocol, pretending to be someone else, or manipulating
messages. Another challenge is the exploration of digital signatures to attack some given system. Thus, it is important to combine those digital signatures with encryption
to enhance security.
